project 5
The data was collected using these questions which I asked to 10 people:
Q1: There is widespread mental health epidemics, problems such as depression and anxiety and many more. But WHY? In our opinion, what is the leading cause and what is the second-leading cause of this collective increase? For each of them can you briefly mention how that factor leads to a mental health problem?

Q2: What is your favorite thing about the modern human life, what is your second-favorite thing, and what is your least-favorite thing?

Q3: name the biggest factor that, in our opinion, today, harms the mental health of mothers specifically.

Q4: name the biggest factor that, in our opinion, today, harms the mental health of fathers specifically. 

Q5: name the biggest factor that, in our opinion, today, harms the mental health of children specifically.

In addition to this, data like age, gender, and years of formal education were also collected
